=================================


------------------
-- Requirements --
------------------
Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1

Note: Because TextAnalysisTool.NET is compiled for .NET 1.1 (instead of .NET
2.0), it is able to run on almost any machine.


-------------------------------
-- Installation Instructions --
-------------------------------
1) Copy TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe (and optionally TextAnalysisTool.NET.txt and
   ReadMe.txt) to a local drive
2) Run TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe

-- Known Issues --
------------------
* GDI+ occasionally throws a System.Runtime.InteropServices.ExternalException
  with the message "A generic error occurred in GDI+.". This exceptional
  condition causes TextAnalysisTool.NET to exit after notifying the user.
* The .NET Framework's improper handling of vertical and horizontal scrollbar
  messages for ListBoxes can cause rendering problems for files with very many
  or very long lines.
* Checkboxes don't always repaint properly due to a .NET Framework bug.
* There is extra flicker when resizing the window. This is due to a workaround
  for an even worse .NET Framework repainting bug.
* ListBox limitations on 16-bit OSes (Windows 95/98/Me) prevent files with
  more than 32,767 lines from displaying properly.

-- Notes --
-----------
One of TextAnalysisTool.NET's core principals is that data should be read one
time as soon as it is available and kept in memory after that. This principle
allows the source data to be amended, changed, or even become unavailable
without affecting the user. Though this principle is an optional convenience
when the data source is a file, it is a strict requirement for data sources
that offer only one chance to read their data (such as the clipboard and plug-
ins). Accordingly, TextAnalysisTool.NET keeps the entire data set in memory at
all times which means that particularly large data sets can tax systems with
comparatively few available resources. The prototypical example is loading a
file that is larger than the amount of memory in the system: performance
suffers. TextAnalysisTool.NET strives to be as responsive as possible under
all circumstances, but is ultimately bound by the resources available to it.

2006-01-11
----------
* Significantly improved performance with large files (load time reduced by
  ~40%, memory use reduced by ~25%, filter time reduced by ~10%)
* Fixed potential null dereference in LineCollectionDisplay.OnDrawItem that is
  extremely rare on all operating systems before Windows Vista (user report)
* Fixed filter display coloration bug when running under .NET 2.0 by working
  around the problem so that the correct behavior is present under both .NET
  1.1 and .NET 2.0 (user report)
* Fixed bug where Ctrl-Alt-[A-Z] didn't work if filtered lines were hidden and
  no lines were displayed
* Fixed bug where the body of the '_' character couldn't be seen with some
  font sizes (including the default)
* Fixed bug where copying text containing '\0' to the clipboard truncated that
  text prematurely

  reading files
* Fixed premature line truncation when drawing lines containing '\u0084'
* Improved performance of toggling markers on high line numbers
* Improved performance of drawing extremely long lines
* Set IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE flag in PE header to enable access to a
  larger virtual memory area when it is available (ex: on 64-bit machines or
  on machines with the /3GB boot option set)
* Added formatting to the XML content of *.tat filter files for improved human
  readability and better revision control (user request)
* Added support for applying Shift modifier key to Ctrl+F to begin a reverse
  find (this shortcut overrides the shortcut for toggling filter f)

* Added short version of file name to window title, makes it easier to switch
  among different windows in the taskbar (user request)
